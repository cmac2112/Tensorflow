# Tensorflow
This repository will hold my tensorflow temperature algorithm using data from the Tulsa International Airport.

For those who are looking at this from my URICA research, in order to run this you will need to add some programs and tweak a line of code or two.
1. install python
2. install tensorflow
3. install pandas
4. change training filepath to the filepath of the csv
5. run it and enjoy waiting for a long time
